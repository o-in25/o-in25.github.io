# Homework 1
**R1** Hosts and end systems are usually used interchangeably. Hosts are often divided into two subsets, that is, clients and servers. Moreover, servers are typically used to describe more powerful computers than those of clients. End systems, however, include all hosts (and therefore all clients and servers), as well as desktop computers, phones, tablets, and laptops. Since a Web sever is a type of host, and hosts are usually interchangeable with end systems, Web servers are then considered end systems.

**R3** Standard of protocols are important because without a standardized method of communication, sending and receiving information would prove difficult. This would be analogous of two people attempting a conversation, but in different languages.

**R4**
Dial-up – home access
Cable Internet access – home access
Cellular mobile lines – WAWA
Wireless LAN – WAWA
Ethernet – enterprise
DSL –home access
##R7 Ethernet LAN’s transmission rates can often be between 10 Mpbs and 10 Gbps

**R8** Ethernet can be transmitted very quickly using fiber optic links and coaxial cables with thick radii. It can also be transmitted less quickly, however, through any twisted-pair copper wire

**R11** Since he total delay would be L/R from the sender and the switch and the delay from the switch and the receiver is L/R, the total time is 2L/R.

**R12** With a circuit-switched network, network quality is guaranteed since a dedicated, persistent connection must be acquired prior to establishing connection, where as, with a packet-switched network, as soon as a connection is established, data can be sent; however, since an indefinite of users can transmit over the network, bottlenecking occurs. In a CSN, TDM provides to be a more powerful and flexible form of multiplexing, because multiple digital signals can sent be transmitted over a single medium, whereas with FDM, there must be delay because only one transmission can be sent at any given time.

**R16** The delays are processing delays, propogation delays, transmission delays, and queuing delays. Queing is variable

**R18** 10 m/sec; d/s; no; no

**R19** 500kbps; 64 seconds; 100kbps; 320 seconds


# Homework 3
**P2** Since at t = NL/R is the time for the first packet to reach, the second one would take t = NL/R + L/R and t = NL/R + L/R for the third, making the total end-to-end time is t - NL/R + (P - 1) * L/R
**P3** 
****a.**** Circuit switched; since the application requires long sessions, the cost of establishing and reestablishing connections would be over a longer duration. 
****b.**** In this case, no congestion control would be necessary, due to the capabilities of the link (i.e. the bandwith).

**R22** Since the probability of packet loss is P, then the probability of no packet loss is (1 - P). The probability of success is (1 - P)^k. Accordingly, this figure of success has implications on the number of retransmits and if all hops are traveled to successfully, there would be no need to retransmit; with less success, more transmits. 

**R23** The five layers are application, transport, network, link, and physical. Application is responsible for managing ports and processes; transport is responsible for the delivery of packets to a process; the network is responsible for network communication; the link is resposnible for internet commuication; the physcial is resposible for the metal to send information.

**R25** Network; link; application/transport

**R19** With a mail exchanger record, which specifies the server responsible for managing incoming mail in the DNS, can link a host name with an IP address, therefore making it possible to have the same alias for a hostname and Web server.

**2** The response contains the sever name, the protocol method and the domain name, which are used by an MX to retrieve the information necessary to display the page.

**3** Using the type as MX, when sending the request to www.xavier.edu, what is returned is the protocol method, as well as postmaster which then identifies the administrator of the mail sever. I learned that this was different than other types used, for example Reverse.
# Homework 7
# Homework 8
**R9** Sequence numbers ensure reliable data transfer; they allow for the sender and the receiver to veryify what packets were sent in what order. This, subsequently, also allows for multiple sending.

**R10** Timers allow both end systems to maintain a time based interval where they can move at a more rapid rate than overhead of acknowledging packets. Additionally, in the worst case, the packets do not send at all and the sequence remains the same.

**R11** Not necessary; the acknowledging bits achieve this inharently. 

**R12** 
****a.**** Upon not receiving the first packet, the recieve, then, ACK's the sender as to which packet sequence failed to send. Following such, the sender will retransmit until the packet is cohesive.
****b.**** When an ACK is recieved, the sender will resend 1 new packet and 5 current packets from the new sequence. From there, it will move on to the new packet on the new sequence.
****c.**** 5 packets will set the amount


**R13**
****a.**** When packets fail to transmit, the receiver will signify so, to which will halt the process until an ACK is recieved 
****b.**** Failing to receiev an ACK will result in a hault
****c.**** The addition of segments will increase the sequence range but will not suffice in resuming the transmission

**P6** Deadlock occurs when the sender or receiver loose the ACK number in the sequence

**P13** This causes the processes to have 0, 1, or 2 waiting periods, whereby the process can continue to send one packet and the sequence can move onto another slot - creating a parallel

**P14** NAK and ACK work in conjunction with one another, where the ACK signifies the previous transmission was succesfully sent, while NAK signifies that the previous transmission has failed. These, together, allow for the state of the transmission to change accordingly.

# Homework 9
**P6** Deadlock is the result of the sender expecting an invalid ACK, but the sender is waiting on the correct ACK.

**R14** 
****a.**** False
****b.**** True
****c.**** True
****d.**** False
****e.**** True
****f.**** False
****g.**** False

**R15**
****a.**** 20 bytes
****b.**** 90; the sequence number is regardless

**R16** 
Segment 1: SEQ = 43; ACK = 80
Segment 2: SEQ = 80; ACK = 80
Segment 3: SEQ = 44; ACK = 81

**P19**  
Searches for ACK; when found, it reiterates into the loop until a new ACK and segment appears


**P26**
****a.**** The sequence number is increaded by the total bytes sent
****b.**** (2^32 / 536) + 66 (header)

**P37** 
****a.**** Go back in: 9 segments. Then, 12345, followed by 2345. Assuming the receiver never received the remaining 4 segements, the sequence number would be 1 for the first send, 5 for the second.
Selective repeat: 6 segments. Then, 12345 and 2 for the misisng segment.
TCP: 6 segments. Then, 12222, marking that it received all but 2 segments. 
****b.**** TCP, inharently, does not have timeout.

**9** 
****a.**** Slow start increasing expontentially; 1-4, 6-9, 17-20, 23-26.
****b.**** Congestion controll models a linear function then drops as to not congest the network.
****c.**** 9; 26; 29
****d.**** ((2^k) * 2) - 1) for x = 4
****e.**** ((2^k) * 2) - 1) for x = 7
**P44** 
****a.**** 6 rounds
****b.**** 21/6 rounds

# Homework 10
**R6** From the text, to appreciate why a hardware implementation is needed, with a router's input ports, output ports, and switching fabric being handled by hardware, consider a 10Gbps input link and a 64-byte IP datagram; the input port has only 51.2ns to process the datagram before another datagram may arrive. If N ports are combined on a line card, the datagram-processing pipeline must operate N times faster - far too fast for software implementation. Similarly, executing routing protocols, performing management functions and comunicating with a SDN, are delt in much longer (by comparison) timeframes, making software a good choice. Additionally, the data plane is the physical forwarding of datagrams, while the control plane is the network-wide logic that routes them.

**R9** It is possible for for a destination address to match more than one entry. When there are multiple matches, the router uses the longest prefix matching rule, where it will find the longest matching entry in the table and forwards the packet to the link associated with the longest prefix match.

**R10** The first of the three types of switching fabrics is switching via memory. Here, switching between input and output ports are done under the control of the CPU and are traditional I/O devices. An input port with an arriving packet first signaled the routing CPU with an interrupt. Then, the packet was copied from the input port into processor memory. The routing CPU then extracted the destination address from the header, looked up the appropriate output port in the forwarding table, and then copied the packet to the output port's buffers. The second fabric is switching via bus. Here, an input port transfers a packet directly to the output port over a shared bus - with no CPU intervention needed. This is done by having the input port prepend a switch-internal header to the packet indicating the local output port to which the packet is being transfered and transmitting thr packet onto the bus. All output ports recieve the packet, but only the port that matches the label will keep it. Finally, the third fabric is switching via an interconnection network. A crossbar switch is an interconnection network consisting of 2n buses that connect N input ports to N output ports. Each vertical bus intersects each horizontal bus at a crosspoint, which can be opened and closed at any time by the switch fabric controller. When a packet arrives from point A and needs to be forwarded to port B, the switch controller closes the crosspoint at the intersection of A and Y, and then port A sends the packet onto its bus, which is picked up by Y. This, unlike its other two variants, supports parallel packet forwarding.

**R11** Packet loss occurs at the input ports when the traffic load or the relative speed of the switching fabric causes the router’s memory to become exhausted, with no room left for another packet. This can be avoided by making the input rate equal to the output rate via linespeed.

**R12** Packet loss occurs at the output ports when there are delays from the switching fabric takes too long to look up address in the table or when there is much demand. This can be circumvented with the use of output queues.

**R13** In an input queued switch, head-of-line blocking occurs when two packets at the front of their input queues are destined for the same output port. Suppose that the switch fabric chooses to transfer another packet. In this case, it must wait for the one before it be outputted. However, the packet that is waiting for 2 packets to "fight" for the same port must wait for an open, uncontested port.

**R2:** No; while each layer provides its own means of reliable delivery, IP does not guarentee that packets arrive in order. Therefore, TCP guarentees proper delivery - not just arrival.
**R4:** While a node is transmitting it will start to receive a packet from the other.
**R5:** When only one node has data to transmit it has throughput of R; all of them
**P1** 1100
# Homework 15
**P31:** (-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1) at d1, (1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1) at d0

**P1:**  (-2) x (-1) + 2x1 + 2x1 + 2x1 / 8 = 1

**P5:**  3(2x1) + (-2)x(-1) / 8 = 1

**R3:** Path loss is due to the natural decay in signal over distance. Multipath propgation is the result of light casuing the signal to become blurry. Interference is caused by multiple transmissions distrupting a signal

**R5:** Beacon frames contains all the information about the network and are transmitted periodically to announce the presence of a Wireless LAN network via an AP

**R6:** True

**R7:** Due to the high rate of failed transmissions due to signal loss, 802.11 requires ACK whereas the reliability of Ethernet does not.

**7:**

****a.**** 0-2312 bytes
****b.**** 1700 bit times
****c.**** The data will be successfully sent because, even if A and B choose the same time peroid, due to exponential backoff, the connection will be sent. If the connection drops, however, it will not be sent.
**8:**

****a.**** A and B will both listen via CSMA
****b.**** The data will be successfully sent because, even if A and B choose the same time peroid, due to exponential backoff, the connection will be sent.
****c.**** The protocol would still work, if B is still in range of A

**R19:** The permanent address is that of the mobile device; the care-of address is the new address of the device when it reaches a new network and is assigned by the foreign network

**R11:**
****a:**** No, since the Distance Vector algorithm is decentralized and takes some time to terminate, so some of the routers may not be able to route to the mobile node.
****b:**** Yes. If a node has just left a foreign network and joined a new one,  the routing entries from the old foreign network might not have been completely removed from the new network are being propagated. 
****c:**** Once a device has been assigned a care-of address

## Part 1
**Question 1:** The difference between the protocol downgrade attack and Cain’s SSL MITM is that the protocol downgrade performed in the lab simply reroutes the traffic from the node to the machine, whereas Cain’s attack collects certificates that “contain the same parameters of the real ones except for asymmetric encryption keys; this deceives a lot of users to accept the server certificate and continue with the session.” The advantages of the protocol downgrade is that the attacker does not know that he or she has traffic that is being rerouted if the IP address and Gateway are exposed. With Cain’s method, SSL must be breached.
